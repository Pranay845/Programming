        different from the corresponding manga chapters. A fourth compilation

      The four seasons of Attack on Titan were met with wide critical acclaim
      with praise for the storyline, animation, action sequences, soundtrack,
      dub performances, and its dark tone. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News
      Network criticized the first two episodes of the anime adaptation, saying
      the director, Araki, "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling,
      but it's just crude and unpleasant." However, other critics from Anime
      News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it "is
      both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and "an excellent mix of what
      18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus
      terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other
      is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next."
      Carlo Santos noted that "few [apocalyptic action shows] get as close to
      perfection as Attack on Titan does". Santos described it as "a masterpiece
      of death and destruction" after watching only the first episode. Theron
      Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the "intense,
      impactful first episode" despite his feeling that it has "limited
      animation". Martin also compared Attack on Titan's vibe and visual
