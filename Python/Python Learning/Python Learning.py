    4. Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).
    5. The keywords (A reserved word that can be understood by a programming language)

It holds a pair of values,
one being the key (These are case sensitive)

Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated,
whereas keys canâ€™t be repeated and must be immutable.
It is also called as mapping type because we map values to keys.
It is like a mixture of set and list with key, value pair

    4. *args and **kwargs (*args: The syntax is to use the symbol * to take in a variable number of arguments;
                           by convention, it is often used with the word args.
                           What *args allows you to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments
                           that you previously defined. With *args, any number of extra arguments can be tacked on to
                           your current formal parameters (including zero extra arguments).
                           
                           **kwargs: The special syntax **kwargs in function definitions in python is used to
                           pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list.
                           We use the name kwargs with the double star.
                           The reason is because the double star allows us to
                           pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).)



A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.
One can think of the kwargs as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it.
That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesn't seem to be any order in which they were printed out.)
    
Normally if we make a function then all the parameters should be specified
but we can make parameters optional or not compulsory by many ways.
These are called as optional parameters.
